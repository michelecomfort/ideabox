#Ideabox Group Project
Create, display, record and archive idea cards.

##Description
Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.”

Do you have a really great idea but you have difficulty keeping track of it in  your brain?! Well IdeaBox is the app that will help you get your best ideas out of your head and onto idea cards that you can reference at any time.

##How it works

- Create an idea card by filling out the title and body input.
- Click the save button to store your new idea.
- Favorite your best ones, or delete the ones that don't inspire you.
- Filter through your saved ideas.
- View your saved ideas all at once.
